Rather than following tutorials, I chose to build a complete, interactive game—my preferred way of learning—focusing on game logic, rendering, and lightweight AI while keeping the experience instantly playable directly on the website.","introVideo":{"name":"TestLink","link":"/portfolio-website/media/snabb-grabb/showcase_spes.mp4"},"devTime":"2 days","engine":"React, TypeScript","genre":"Pong","groupSize":1,"sections":[{"name":"Learning React","explenation":"This little pong game was created because I wanted to learn more about react and typescript.

I visualized these using styled divs, without worrying about how the game was rendered—just mapping Vectors 1–100 to the screen size. This approach made implementation much easier, as rendering size could be completely ignored when developing the AI systems.","code":["<div","  className={`${PongStyle.paddle} ${PongStyle.leftPaddle}`}","  style={{","    insetBlockStart: `${leftPaddle.current.collider.GetTop()}vh`,","    backgroundColor: `${leftAi.current.GetModeColor()}`,","  }}","/>"],"language":"tsx"},{"name":"Drawing Lines","explenation":"To make debugging easier, I added a feature that draws visual debug lines to display Vector2 positions.

I considered making a more advanced AI but decided to keep it lightweight for a quick weekend project. The system is still flexible enough to add new states or AIs with different behaviors later on.\nAfter that, I ran into a common problem—the AI was simply too good. To fix this, I added a randomized skill level for each AI at the start of every round. Higher skill levels make the AI move more accurately and slightly faster (up to the player’s speed). This creates a nice balance, making some rounds more challenging while others feel fairer. This all being extremly lightweight meaning it can play at incredible speeds with no trouble as can be seen in this video","video":{"name":"Fast AI","link":"/portfolio-website/media/pong/fast_pong.mp4"},"textArea":"left"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
