At its core is a base Interactable class, with specialized subclasses like Holdable. In this architecture, any object that can be picked up also contains the logic for consumption or usage. This allowed me to rapidly implement diverse behaviors (such as fruits providing nutrition or batteries recharging power) by simply overriding the use-method within the holdable subclass. This modular approach ensured that adding new items late in the jam did not break existing game logic."},{"name":"Atmospheric Cycle & Fail-States","explenation":"The game features a dynamic day-night cycle driven by a rotating directional light system. I tuned the cycle to provide a 2:1 ratio of daylight to darkness, creating a grace period for resource gathering before the lighthouse becomes a critical requirement. Technically, the lighthouse acts as the primary fail-state; if the battery is not maintained through the night, the player loses. This system also drives visual feedback, illuminating ships in the distance only when the lighthouse beam is active, reinforcing the player’s purpose.","video":{"name":"Lighthouse Spinning","link":"/portfolio-website/media/aeon/Aeon_ParticleSys.mp4"}},{"name":"Resource Balancing & Crop Growth","explenation":"The core gameplay loop centers on high-stakes crop management. Each plant type is defined by variables including growth time, yield, nutritional value, and electrical recharge capacity. I implemented a scaling growth system with a UI progress overlay to provide clear feedback. This forced players into strategic decision-making: choosing between slow-growing, high-yield investment crops or quick-growing, low-yield varieties for immediate survival, creating a constant tension between long-term planning and short-term needs.","video":{"name":"Plants growing","link":"/portfolio-website/media/aeon/Aeon_ParticleSys.mp4"}},{"name":"Reflection","explenation":"Lonely Lighthouse was a lesson in scope management and focused design. Building every system independently, from the resource hierarchy to the lighting cycle, allowed me to ensure total cohesion between the mechanics and the theme. Winning two awards at the jam validated my ability to execute a complete vertical slice under pressure. If I were to revisit this project, I would implement a clear win condition or a path off the island. While the game was built to explore the difficulty of isolation, providing a 'way out' would offer a more balanced and ultimately hopeful experience for the player."}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
